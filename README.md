## What's new

disabled by deafult; use `[p]picks set auto-dm on` to enable.)
- 2018-04-01: Updated [Pick](#pick) to allow @member and #channel mentions in event names. 
- 2018-01-07: Updated [Helpless](#helpless) with the ability to disable global help command and help via DMs.
- 2018-01-03: New year, new README. Also added [Helpless](#helpless) which filters help messages based on 
[Squid-Plugins Permissions](https://github.com/tekulvw/Squid-Plugins).


## CommandSearch
Lets you search for commands on your bot.

### Commands
- **cmds** lists all commands on your bot that contain `search_string`. 
    ```
    [p]commandsearch|cmds|coms <search_string>
    ```

## GNU
An attempt to emulate some common GNU utilities. 

### Input and Output
All commands accept input from the following:

- Website content if a valid URL is specified
- Chat log if @chat is specified (Chat log must be enabled for the channel, e.g. `!clog on`)
- Any text following the command if none of the above are detected.

The following options for input and output apply to all non-administrative commands:

```
Global Options
    -p       If input is a URL, this will treat the URL content as (prettified) html instead of a DOM.
    -@       Same as -p except source is not passed through BeautifulSoup's prettify().
    -%       Print each line as a separate message; more likely to hit Discord's 5/5 rate limit.
```

Chat log options can be configured with the <b>clog</b> command.

### Pipes
Output from one GNU command can be piped to the input of another GNU command. Does not work with non-GNU commands.

```[p]sed "s/^.{0,20}$//" http://news.google.com | grep -i apple | sed s/apple/Orange/i | tail -n 5```

Prefix is optional for commands that appear after a pipe. 

### Redirected output
Output can be redirected to [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) instead of Discord chat with one of the following:

- `> paste_title` creates a 24 hr pastebin  
- `>> paste_title` creates a permanent pastebin  

A link to the generated pastebin will be posted in chat. When used with pipes, the redirect must appear at the end.

```[p]cat -b http://news.google.com | grep -rm 10 .{40,} > somenews```

A <a href="http://pastebin.com/api">pastebin API key</a> is required for this feature. Save the API key with the command:

```[p]pastebin [api_key]```

### Commands
- **grep** prints lines that contain a match for a pattern.
    ```
    grep [options] [pattern] [input]
    
    Matching Options
        -i       Ignore case distinctions, so that characters that differ only in case match each other.
        -w       Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words.
        -v       Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.
        -r       Treats search string as a regex pattern; other Matching Options are ignored.
    
    Output Options
        -c       Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.
        -n       Prefix each line of output with its line number.
        -m num   Stop reading from input after num matching lines.
        -A num   Print num lines of trailing context after matching lines.
        -B num   Print num lines of leading context before matching lines.
        -C num   Print num lines of leading and trailing context.
    ```

- **sed** is a simple stream editor.
    ```
    sed [options] [script] [input]
    
    Options
        -g       Process entire input as a single string, rather than line by line.
        -n       Disable automatic printing; only produce output when explicitly told to.
    
    Script Address
        /.../    Returns lines that match the regular expression.
        A        Returns line number A.
        A,B      Returns lines from A to B.
        A~N      Returns every Nth line, starting from A
    
    Script Command
        a...     Append after each line.
        c...     Change lines with new line.
        d        Delete lines.
        i...     Insert before each line.
        p        Print line.
        s/././   Substitute with regular expression pattern.
        =        Print line number.
    
    Script Pattern Flag
        /i       Ignore case
        /p       Print (mostly used when -n option is active)
    ```

- **wc** counts the number of characters, whitespace-separated words, and newlines in the given input.
    ```
    wc [option] [input]
    
    Options
        -m      Print only the character counts.
        -w      Print only the word counts.
        -l      Print only the newline counts.
    ```

- **cat** echoes the contents of the input.
    ```
    cat [options] [input]
    
    Options
        -b      Number all nonempty output lines, starting with 1.
        -n      Number all output lines, starting with 1. This option is ignored if -b is in effect.
        -s      Suppress repeated adjacent blank lines; output just one empty line instead of several.
    ```

- **tac** echoes input to output in reverse by line or user specified separator.
    ```
    tac [options] [input]
    
    Options
        -s sep  Use "sep" as the record separator, instead of newline.
        -r      Treat the separator string as a regular expression.
    ```

    ```
    tail [options] [input]
    
    Options
        -n [+]num   Output the last num lines. However, if num is prefixed with a '+'
                    start printing with line num from the start of input, instead of from the end.
    ```

## Helpless
Allows owner to disable the global help command, disallow help via DMs, and/or hide help based on 
[Squid-Plugins Permissions](https://github.com/tekulvw/Squid-Plugins). If you are the bot owner, you will not notice 
any difference when you use the help command because you always have permissions for everything. If you want to test 
the help filters, login as a different Discord user.

### Commands

This disables `[p]help` when used without any arguments.
    ```

This allows `[p]help` to be used without any arguments.

    ```

- **helpless bot msg** sets the placeholder message that is displayed when bot help is disabled.
    ```

    ```
    helpless dm on
    ```

- **helpless dm off** turns off DM help filtering. This allows users to use the help command in DMs.
    ```
    helpless dm off
    ```

- **helpless dm msg** sets the placeholder message that is displayed when DM help is disabled.
    ```
    helpless dm msg <msg>
    ```

    helpless p on
    ```

- **helpless p off** turns off help filtering based on Squid-Plugins Permissions cog.

notify you when new torrents matching user defined criteria appear on the site.

This cog will install [js2py](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Js2Py) to access TokyoTosho behind CloudFlare. If this does 
not happen automatically, you can manually install it with `pip3 install js2py`

### Commands
- **tt search** will search for torrents based on search terms and category.

               tt search madoka rebellion -dub #anime
               tt search madoka #music
    ```

- **tt add** will add an RSS alert to your channel. The bot will display torrent name and link when a new torrent 
matching the configured `terms` and `categories` (optional) appears in TokyoTosho's RSS feed. Note you can specify 
    ```
    tt add <terms> [#categories]
